# Real-time-Sign-Language-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
Sign Language Detection using TensorFlow, MediaPipe & OpenCV

A real-time sign language recognition system built using MediaPipe’s hand tracking pipeline and a TensorFlow deep learning model.

🚀 Project Overview

This project is a real-time Sign Language Recognition System that detects and classifies hand gestures from live webcam feed.

It uses MediaPipe to extract accurate 3D hand landmarks and a TensorFlow CNN model to classify them into sign language alphabets.
The system is fast, lightweight, and works in real time.
